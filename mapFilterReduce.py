# 1. MAP: map is very useful when applying a function to all elements in a list.

# 2. FILTER: filter only returns elements for which the passed function is TRUE.

# 3. REDUCE: from left to right, apply function to list, two elements at a time.
# Start by setting _acc to func(lst[0], lst[1]), and then to func(_acc, lst[2])
